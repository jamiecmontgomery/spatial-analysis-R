R is getting better and better for spatial data visualization and analyses. This tutorial specifically focuses on working with raster, or gridded, data in R.

The tutorial is laid out as an exploratory analyses similar to those I've done myself. The objective of this tutorial is to use different types of raster data to answer the fictional scientific question:

####What areas within the California Current are suitable for seamonkey aquaculture?

Along the way you'll learn how to **read**, **reproject**, **crop**, **mask**, run **calculations and zonal statistics**, **plot**, **save** and more with raster data in RStudio.
